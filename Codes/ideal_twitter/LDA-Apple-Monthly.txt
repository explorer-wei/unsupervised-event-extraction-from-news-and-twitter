title text Fitch Street InterView smartphone Samsung vs. Apple DATE Mon Oct EDT NEWS SOURCE   following release rating agency   October   Fitch   week Matt Jamieson speak Alvin Lim Fitch technology analyst base Seoul about ongoing legal dispute between Apple Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.   stable   Matt Head APAC Research Fitch corporate rating Group he ask Alvin number key question include nature dispute likely outcome potential credit implication Samsung whether Apple recent release revise iPhone oppose altogether new iPhone model could positive Samsung Matt so Alvin what real story behind legal battle currently go between Samsung Apple Alvin well short Apple sue Samsung over look feel smartphone tablet Samsung sue Apple over technology use 3g communication Apple claim own sole rights make rectangular glass multi-touch device minimalist design other word only one button front panel other hand Samsung claim Apple would able manufacture smartphone without use Samsung patented technology which make possible device send receive datum through air Matt why do you think Apple take up Samsung other smartphone manufacturer like HTC LG Electronics   BBB stable   Alvin because Samsung clearly Apple biggest threat smartphone arena during Apple lead world ship million smartphone Samsung close second million unit importantly Q3 Samsung would likely have surpass Apple sale volume korean company ramp up sale its flagship galaxy ii smartphone unveil April iPhone growth would likely have level off consumer await new model late last week Samsung Electronics release its preliminary q3 sale operating profit number while profitability slightly down year year number stronger than market expect clear indication Samsung handset business do very well able offset subdue growth company currently experience other major business unit particularly DRAM memory chip flat panel display tv set apart from Samsung Apple most other global mobile phone manufacturer currently generate strong cashflow handset division include big name like Nokia   BBB negative   Sony Ericsson LG Electronics so Apple focus its legal resource Samsung only because believe Samsung copy its design importantly because Samsung strongest position continue compete aggressively Apple over medium long-term Matt do you think legal dispute have potential pull back current trajectory Samsung mobile division Alvin significantly Samsung have strong ability release competitive new smartphone timely basis have prove cost competitiveness thanks its vertical integration compare Apple one product offering which so far only revamp every two year Samsung provide full platform low high-end model have number new smartphone pipeline which release over next six month Matt yes notice Apple recent release iPhone meet some disappointment many hope completely new iPhone rather than update iPhone do you think represent opportunity Samsung Alvin definitely so from hardware perspective Samsung Galaxy s2 have some key advantage over iPhone include lighter notwithstanding larger screen size so number android-based app increase rapidly every day many new existing smartphone user tempt Samsung galaxy s2 also notably late September Samsung unveil new model support new lte 4g technology Galaxy s2 lte Galaxy s2 hd lte contrast Apple have decide incorporate LTE technology its latest iPhone so user concern about future-proof from network technology point view Samsung clearly have marketing edge moment Matt come back legal dispute what Samsung perspective matter why have recently change stance become more aggressive bring patent infringement suit against Apple when release iPhone Alvin yes true Samsung have now launch more aggressive counter attack risk lose large amount order component   include mobile memory chip display   from Apple however Apple have so far refuse all settlement offer from android manufacturer have successfully convince court ban Samsung tablet Germany prevent release Australia push hard have Samsung device ban other major country so little room leave negotiation moment Samsung decide use occasion release Apple iPhone become more serious its counter attack Matt how do you see patent suit resolve Alvin stage hard predict exactly different law suit go across nine country trial likely extend more than one year however both company able ban each other product various country logical solution would Samsung Apple agree cross-license each other patent moment Apple have slight edge have successfully able ban Samsung product Germany remain see whether Samsung turn able have Apple device ban certain country well Matt which bring my final question what impact do you think issue could have Samsung credit profile what happen one-sided victory Apple Alvin believe one-sided victory Apple highly unlikely worst-case scenario eventuate clearly would weigh negatively Samsung credit profile Samsung mobile business division account around its revenue operating profit Apple win most law suit Samsung force recalibrate design its smartphone clear any patent infringement while maintain sufficient consumer appeal hence Samsung sale margin would negatively impact interim period however rather than outright victory one side note one-sided victory Samsung would quite negative Apple well compromise more likely where one side may gain slight advantage significantly importantly from regulatory point view Samsung hold flag many other smartphone maker would unlikely major court around world rule manner which ban Android operating system-based competition from compete against Apple device perhaps more important Samsung short-term could loss order memory chip display panel other component Apple source its various product while Apple contribution Samsung revenue operate profit disclose we watch closely from overall

account no-no many corporation Exchange datum only through Exchange account you can import export contact android device via sd card   support external storage   so you could export you computer contact file move sd card fine work-around initial setup ongoing synchronization where iOS fall surprisingly short its lack support creation group support email group create you computer available you

iOS link contact card create virtual group example you have separate entry couple you can link card so each person contact information appear both card Android Honeycomb both support group let you create though process unintuitive when you add edit contact field which you can select create group you can start create group add contact instead you have go each contact turn also group capability available exchange-based contact you can send email group so feature have little value Gingerbread do support group all corporate email contact calendar support Android Gingerbread significantly inferior iOS when come corporate email capability mostly because Gingerbread support very limited set Exchange activesync   ea   policy so most corporate Exchange environment unlikely permit access biggest omission support on-device encryption which basic ea requirement you can tell Exchange ignore policy miss let any noncompliant device onto Exchange server viable option most business you want use android smartphone secure Exchange server you need use client app NitroDesk TouchDown provide secure eas-compatible outlook-style function mobile device management   mdm   combo beta divide app

corporate server pass we Exchange activesync policy particularly like how Honeycomb let know specifically what permission grant over device detail provide iOS overall iOS have slight edge Exchange policy support over Android Honeycomb both should work natively moderately secure Exchange environment also android do let you automatically sync Exchange folder you have go each folder manually update contrast iOS let you designate which folder automatically synce part mail setting both iOS Android integrate Exchange contact mail app so look you exchange contact database well you local

time get those app where extra work Gingerbread you press grid icon bottom screen get full set install app Honeycomb you tap Apps button upper right home screen fortunately copying app home screen easy modal switch still annoying contrast iOS simply add more home screen you pick up app easily let you arrange drag   you can rearrange app Android app screen just its home screen   iOS also let you add web page home screen app great many mobile web page essentially web app beta version InfoWorld mobile site let you take quiz play we slideshow Android can add bookmark only its browser bookmark list iOS let you create app folder which can useful reduce scrolling among home page unfortunately folder icon still too small make out so know what folder always easy Android also have folder capability tap hold Home screen get contextual menu tap New Folder option name folder something other than New Folder tap folder open tap hold its menu bar open keyboard so you can enter new name yes procedure awkward both operating system alert you app update let you download wirelessly iOS also let you manage app   include home screen arrangement   update via iTunes so back up you computer one app advantage Samsung version Android Honeycomb its widget feature widget mini app you can place home screen can very helpful show latest email message Facebook update current time large clock thus you can see glance current status whatever you want easily track neither Android Gingerbread nor iOS have ability Honeycomb base tablet from other manufacturer do have either so can credit Android both version Android have long offer notification capability pop-up notification make easy see you have new email other alert whatever you happen do tablet alert appear lower right you screen top Android smartphone both case you can pull up notification pane see recent alert iOS have basic notification capability app use notification API could set sound alert indicate number open message via badge home screen app icon display alert window iOS have copy android-style capability what call Notification Center Apple version better iOS you pull down from top screen get pane notification tap any open within its app you can also delete group notification mail message tap icon right group name like iOS notification better than Android because iOS notification much easier read Notification Center show individual message tweet whereas some case android show only group alert new mention rather than list   iOS let you specify max number notification per type display way   iOS can also display notification lock screen slide specific notification icon you can open app relevant notification item email plus unlike Android iOS let you decide which app may present notification lock screen elsewhere you restricted predetermined set only do iOS let you turn notification off per-app basis you can specify whether notification sound tone whether appear lock screen whether its badge update number relevant notification how notification appear onscreen   overlay middle you screen calendar do default appointment just Notification Center pull-down pane   you get choose when how you interrupted iOS add new storage management apus ease file handling when you want free up space setting app usage pane now show how much storage each app consume you tap compatible app list you get sublist all its document file which you can delete individually need non-compatible app show only total datum usage you need manage document within app themselves via iTunes file management facility Android can show how much space app type datum   music   take have file manager nor facility like iOS   you can buy file manager app Android Market   winner iOS outdo Android notification capability improve its app switching capability add automatic document syncing Apple tv-mediated presentation plus Apple app catalog large you use smartphone tablet work just web surfing content consumption iOS take you very close able work without pc Android capability pretty strong especially you business need minimal simply good iOS Deathmatch web internet both Apple Google strong force behind html5 other modern browser technology so surprise both offer capable web browser base html5 test site score Safari iOS have take major leap forward html5 compatibility compare its previous version chart below show only desktop os Chrome Firefox beta internet Explorer support more html5 capability than iOS mobile Safari browser contrast Android WebOS BlackBerry lag significantly experience html5 advantage firsthand iOS Safari newfound support contenteditable attribute html5 thus its ability work many capability WYSIWYG AJAX web-editing tool tinymce use Drupal countless other site Hallelujah   item drag do work perhaps because iOS drag gesture start tap which open drag handle internal url thus block any drag action   now can do most my work InfoWorld content directly we content management system from my ipad percent text selection AJAX float dialog box often grab content underneath example least possible now Android Honeycomb Gingerbread browser also support TinyMCE WYSIWYG JavaScript editor widely use web form allow rich text editing experience repeat display problem rich text window always refresh its contents after scroll text selection do always work either other JavaScript window have display problem well significant typing scrolling lag some case scroll gesture would work none happen iOS from operational perspective main difference between iOS Android browser center UI all three have persistent button field back forward Bookmarks Refresh navigate tabbed pane ipad iOS now show row tab top each open browser window do Android Honeycomb both iOS iPhone Android Gingerbread make you tap button see how many window open switch iOS also add two feature debut Mac OS version Safari Lion Reading list Snow Leopard Reader read list separate bookmarking utility mean content page you want read later remove from list whereas Reader strip out most web page so you can concentrate its contents Android have equivalent either feature both iOS Android can share page via email iOS also let you share page via Twitter   iOS have integrate Twitter many its service   plus iOS can print page wireless printer either printer local unit connect via one many printing app available iOS Android have native printing capability third-party printing app available include app work Google Cloud print service send print job through you desktop computer directly eprint printer note however Cloud print still beta testing after year however iOS separate search url box less convenient than Android unify url search box you have sure tap right box iOS Android also have separate search control you prefer both iOS Android Honeycomb offer com button when enter url which significant timesaver both os pop up list alternative domain edu org when you tap hold com button Android Gingerbread have equivalent both iOS Android you can select text graphic web page only iOS let you copy graphic Android can save graphic tablet local storage whereas iOS can save image its Photos app both iOS Android browser offer setting control pop-up window search engine JavaScript cookie history cache form datum password image loading autofill fraud warning debugging use cloud-based Google Docs either mobile os pleasant experience barely possible edit spreadsheet most you can do select add row well edit contents individual cell you can edit text document awkwardly partly because Google have figure out effective mobile interface web app Safari Chrome browser simply deal what Google present rather than work through mobile-friendly front end some limitation may due fact mobile Safari Chrome browser do support all same capability desktop counterpart give iOS Safari now work well many ajax-based website think fault lay mostly Google Docs team thing have improve bit Google Docs front year example you can create edit navigate appointment Google Calendar all four its view   day week month agenda   pretty much you can desktop browser iOS versus iOS Safari page cache seem more stable you can switch away from tab come back less chance web page refreshing lose any change you may have make web form have issue Android suspect part why iOS handle browser caching better because under-the-hood improvement relate multitask although preinstal android Adobe Flash Player available Android Market free download beta version work my testing variety website use Flash both video interactive capability find most current Flash Player     do well video basic Flash animation those let you rotate view open content via hotspot like flash game work sometimes other android device use earlier version Flash Player   well rim BlackBerry PlayBook run current version   have have trouble run Flash content appear after year effort Adobe may close finally break string Flash failure iOS course have flash support give Apple dislike Adobe Flash technology one work-around Flash video only skyfire iPad app     Skyfire web browser app     iPhone iPod Touch Android also offer voice-based search text input iOS do after tap microphone icon speak text you wait few seconds search term transmit Google server conversion text result surprisingly good process usually take longer than typing term especially constrain onscreen keyboard smartphone   can get idea talk my tablet least its utility confine smartphone   iOS have nothing like unless you count voice-based Siri personal assistant technology ship beta software iPhone due Oct. because Siri run just one iOS device can count iOS advantage even available testing winner iOS mile thanks greater html5 compatibility its addition tabbed pane iPad its ability copy graphic Flash important you Android become you only dependable option Deathmatch Location support both iOS Android support gp location both can triangulate location base wi-fus signal also come Google Maps which can find you current destination provide direction otherwise help you navigate use Google Maps bit more work Android Gingerbread than iOS Honeycomb switch view from map satellite due use nested menu Android version Google Maps also have print option unlike iOS version beta Navigation app come android much better navigation app than Maps app come iOS ipad iPhone you want real navigation app Navigon MobileNavigator whereas android device you could stick free one both iOS Android let developer integrate location information app so location just another native feature both iOS Android let you control you location privacy however Android only let you control whether you location detect disable enable gp wi-fus location service entire device whereas iOS let you control location service per application android app can ask ok use you location central way manage location permission iOS plus iOS add extra control system-level service include iad time zone compass calibration traffic service cell network search diagnostic iOS now also differentiate its presentation those app currently track you location from those have do so last hour winner tie iOS give user much more control over location policy do provide good navigation app android Deathmatch user interface often throwaway comment Apple ui better than everyone else always true   mobileme service attest   mobile iOS fact better-designed UI one make access capability information easier faster iOS do mess what you already know do enhance UI further Notification Center improve gesture support much simpler synchronization capability few enhance setting operational uus note earlier how Android Gingerbread make you click menu button go through one more level option access most capability its app really slow smartphone operation even though consistently implement Apple smarter about bring common capability top level iOS app ui so accessible through quick tap yet do clutter up screen even iPhone another example Google poor uus choice android smartphone have search button always functional you press when say read email do nothing however you press when view contact let you search you address book clear why search button available some context other especially app like email have search capability fortunately Home button always work Android Honeycomb less awkward use than Gingerbread take advantage tablet larger screen so do iOS iPad setting app both version Android can confusing example two wi-fi option wi-fus wi-fus setting tap wi-fus turn off wi-fus what expect find wi-fi network you tap wi-fi setting after while learn difference unnecessary exercise contrast iOS do let you confuse turn wi-fus off select network thanks single location clearly designate control good news pinch zoom well autorotation you turn device work equivalently android iOS iOS make better use gesture you can navigate among run app new motion well go home screen open multitasking dock iOS also have strong uus support visually option zoom text present screen high contrast enable text-to-speech text selection iOS augmented gesture assistance those motor coordination issue android simply do accommodate need nice change iOS ability set custom sound various alert now room full iphone ipad you have better chance know whether you device just beep android do allow per-app alert tone configuration iOS longer require you connect computer set up iOS let you set up device update OS wirelessly which Android have do from day one text entry find iOS on-screen keyboard slightly easier work than Android clearer key better contextual use extra key Mail application although android Honeycomb make good use tab other key find iOS iPad result keyboard quite full size landscape orientation   whereas iOS ipad   thus tad difficult touch-typing sure eventually get use remain annoying uus decision also like iOS new split keyboard option iPad which make easy thumb-type while hold ipad both hand simple turn mode off you type addition iOS let you float regular keyboard those time you want see full screen contents behind Android have nothing like warn however when type rapidly onscreen regular keyboard my ipad frequently switch split keyboard can figure out what tap cause switch really annoying seemingly random text selection copying android fall short its text selection you tap away realize you have make mistake catch autocorrect feature when enter url can difficult move text cursor typo location text you tap too long screen fill Edit text contextual menu take while figure out how tap long enough move text-insertion cursor new location text without open menu Gingerbread Honeycomb have tweak text selection so more precise now slider move text cursor enhance control universal across app contrast iOS you tap hold where you want insert text cursor   sort like use mouse   magnifier appear help you move precisely where you want go you add delete text location plus control text selection appear so you can use those you would like worry about some screen-filling menu appear Android Gingerbread text-selection control Android Honeycomb more like iOS less precise bit harder control via touch than iOS copy paste even basic selection often available Android some field tap hold bring up Edit text contextual menu let you copy paste entire field contents other you can even do although browser let you select copy text ability universal example you can select text email message iOS any textual item can select easy intuitive universal winner iOS mile Android awkward text-handling feature inexcusable even some recent enhancement people use regular cellphone BlackBerrys Palm OS device thrill Android Gingerbread UI certainly friend colleague show Android feel way you familiar iOS UI iPhone Android smartphone UI feel clunky bit awkward you force use Windows Linux difference usability between iOS tablet android Honeycomb tablet stark nonetheless iOS easier use its capability more universally available Deathmatch Security management Apple know support security client management demand yet iOS second only BlackBerry term enterprise security management support have remote wipe authentication assortment password control   require strong password disable access after specify number fail log-in attempt   manageable through Microsoft Exchange soon through ios-enabled management tool from company good technology mobileiron iOS also support several type vpn provide SSL message encryption have on-device encryption all datum can turn off contrast Android security manageability Android Gingerbread simply can meet most corporate security need little way mobile management hook OS third-party management tool provider tap biggest omission lack on-device encryption which pretty much render Android unusable corporate Exchange environment previously note individual app can implement encryption within sandbox NitroDesk TouchDown do rarely have way ensure only app deploy   Exchange ea policy detection one those rare way secure email calendar contact app mobile device   one option get one Motorola mobility recent Android Gingerbread smartphone Atrix 4g droid Photon 4G Xprt which Motorola have add on-device encryption work Exchange ea policy requirement Photon 4g test work perfectly well under we corporate ea policy Android smartphone use 3lm add-on security layer android should begin appear make corporate support Android more plausible less labor-intensive situation markedly better out-of-the-box Android Honeycomb Google have recognize Android security deficiency have add on-device encryption Honeycomb you have enable manually only do encrypt tablet take hour battery have fully charge before you can begin even you plug wall socket   rationale battery need full capacity case power go out power cord disconnect   can take several hour before you android tablet finally encrypted ready use fortunately one-time activity Android Honeycomb come close match iOS support ea policy   unlike Android Gingerbread smartphone   allow complex password password expiration password history restriction Honeycomb can enforce policy disable camera control access wi-fi access point block use app store iOS can both version Android do support complex password vpn ssl message encryption neither could connect InfoWorld peap-secured wi-fus network despite display peap-oriented dialog box when try initiate connection contrast iOS have trouble connect peap-secured wi-fus network   Google tell peap support require extra work both user create connection company look make process simple iOS future update   Android can back up setting contact calendar email datum wirelessly Gmail can iOS Apple icloud service addition iOS can back up all you device datum app iTunes both over usb connection new iOS over wi-fus course most large business would prefer have iTunes corporate pc even iOS support back up specified type datum one computer other type other computer keep datum backup separated base type still whether you back up icloud iTunes you get option encrypt those backup security feature should appreciate winner only iOS can meet midlevel corporate security manageability requirement Android Honeycomb come close enough many business Android Gingerbread real option unless you bypass native Android capability install manageable email client from firm NitroDesk Good Technology Enterproid   still beta   MobileIron Zenprise overall winner question which better mobile OS iOS beat both android Honeycomb Gingerbread almost every category iOS have significantly widen lead several area include application web internet user interface nevertheless Android Honeycomb offer strong core

investment daily weekly basis you advice much appreciate very respectfully -lsb- -rsb- get think get so irritated hearing Wall Street blowhard brag about how pull trigger trade refresh hear from someone who know what expression really mean hate think same Wall Street crowd get its hook guy money while he out serve behalf so start think about where he should start he investment my response come two part Dear Lieutenant thank you you email more importantly thank you deeply service country Bravo open Roth IRA so young make maximum contribution each year you already ahead game you age most people borrow spend rather than save you go want money when you older Roth definitely way go money grow tax-free you retirement earlier you start invest better you should do because you have more time money grow my math you should have about invest so far you re right cash long-term investment bust right now you re get interest consumer price rise about do math say you fear lose money Wall Street you instead lose money inflation Historically investor have able earn year above inflation over long term so how should you invest you money let start say how you should invest first piece advice give you wouldn bother pick individual stock do yourself favor invest mutual fund you re busy you re work full-time you presumably away tour long period invest individual stock hard time-consuming surprisingly expensive commission unnecessary over time overwhelming bulk you return aren go come from individual security re go come from pick right asset stock versus bond so sure you probably know somebody who make fortune say Apple case rare   typically popular growth stock lose you more money than make you anyway every Apple   AAPL US   Krispy Kreme   KKD US   Sirius XM Radio   SIRI US   where stock crash fascinating research which show general you actually much better off invest Wall Street dog stock nobody want than star   second piece advice watch out Wall Street just die sucker you investment high fee over time kill you return Wall Street have grow rich off commission fund management fee   worst offender hedge-fund manager   old joke go trader salesman end up expensive yacht you hunt vain customer yacht all thing equal look investment mutual fund charge you low fee so how should you invest go start lay out some conventional advice wrong you busy have neither time nor inclination go further should serve you well over next three four decade conventional wisdom Wall Street recommend standard portfolio stock bond rebalance once twice year sell what rise spend money buy what fall restore original allocation someone you age might cut bond allocation down even lower grounds you can afford take more risk which Wall Street mean volatility you feel comfortable simple portfolio one have number flaw miss out some investment class far too heavily weighted toward U.S. investment would have cost you plenty over past decade contrary what you hear overseas investment necessarily more risky here broader version standard portfolio U.S. stock e.g. USAA Extended Market Index Fund   USMIX US   european japanese australian stock e.g. Vanguard Extended Market Index   VDMIX US   emerge market stock e.g. Vanguard emerge Markets Stock Index   VEIEX US   bond index   include U.S. Treasury bond corporate   e.g. Vanguard Total Bond Market Index   VBMFX US   Treasury bond   know tip   e.g. Vanguard Securities Fund   VIPSX US   commodity e.g. GreenHaven continuous commodity exchange-traded fund   gcc US   iPath Dow Jones CUBS Commodity Index Total return note   djp US   precious metal e.g. SPDR Gold Trust   GLD US   Central Fund   CEF US   closed-end fund hold gold silver you want cut you bond allocation you could put each three stock fund each two bond fund   leave last two fund unchanged     New so-called lifecycle fund which tailor you age target retirement date do whole allocation you have mostly stock when you young raise bond portion you go higher don like very much because all far too heavily weighted toward U.S. stock generally give you too little weight any commodity precious metal   theory behind diversification over long term stock have outperform bond have more volatile precious metal offer portfolio insurance have typically do best when everything else have do badly commodity offer protection against inflation perhaps rise danger global shortage cap off strategy principle dollar cost averaging mean invest you money slowly over time Don commit all you fund once way you ll minimize risk buy top some security expensive today fall due course so even though you ll overpay those you buy now you ll probably get bargain those you buy later so you have say invest you could decide invest every quarter next two half year base portfolio above would mean invest each three stock fund apiece each bond fund apiece commodity gold fund   one technical note you pay trading commission commodity gold fund exchange-traded so you might want invest more fewer interval keep those commission down   you go down route you have stay disciplined ignore headline ignore you emotion ignore greed fear mood market just keep invest exactly same amount money same investment same interval forget all about say conventional wisdom over next year should do you just fine require minimum effort you part fee low easy you only option my second
