Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. -lrb- stable -rrb- Matt Head APAC Research Fitch corporate rating Group he ask Alvin number key question include nature dispute likely outcome potential credit implication Samsung whether Apple recent release revise iPhone oppose altogether new iPhone model could positive Samsung Matt so Alvin what real story behind legal battle currently go between Samsung Apple Alvin well short Apple sue Samsung over look feel smartphone tablet Samsung sue Apple over technology use 3g communication Apple claim own sole rights make rectangular glass multi-touch device minimalist design other word only one button front panel other hand Samsung claim Apple would able manufacture smartphone without use Samsung patented technology which make possible device send receive datum through air Matt why do you think Apple take up Samsung other smartphone manufacturer like HTC LG Electronics -lrb- BBB stable -rrb- Alvin because Samsung clearly Apple biggest threat smartphone arena during Apple lead world ship million smartphone Samsung close second million unit importantly Q3 Samsung would likely have surpass Apple sale volume korean company ramp up sale its flagship galaxy ii smartphone unveil April iPhone growth would likely have level off consumer await new model late last week Samsung Electronics release its preliminary q3 sale operating profit number while profitability slightly down year year number stronger than market expect clear indication Samsung handset business do very well able offset subdue growth company currently experience other major business unit particularly DRAM memory chip flat panel display tv set apart from Samsung Apple most other global mobile phone manufacturer currently generate strong cashflow handset division include big name like Nokia -lrb- BBB negative -rrb- Sony Ericsson LG Electronics so Apple focus its legal resource Samsung only because believe Samsung copy its design importantly because Samsung strongest position continue compete aggressively Apple over medium long-term Matt do you think legal dispute have potential pull back current trajectory Samsung mobile division Alvin significantly Samsung have strong ability release competitive new smartphone timely basis have prove cost competitiveness thanks its vertical integration compare Apple one product offering which so far only revamp every two year Samsung provide full platform low high-end model have number new smartphone pipeline which release over next six month Matt yes notice Apple recent release iPhone meet some disappointment many hope completely new iPhone rather than update iPhone do you think represent opportunity Samsung Alvin definitely so from hardware perspective Samsung Galaxy s2 have some key advantage over iPhone include lighter notwithstanding larger screen size so number android-based app increase rapidly every day many new existing smartphone user tempt Samsung galaxy s2 also notably late September Samsung unveil new model support new lte 4g technology Galaxy s2 lte Galaxy s2 hd lte contrast Apple have decide incorporate LTE technology its latest iPhone so user concern about future-proof from network technology point view Samsung clearly have marketing edge moment Matt come back legal dispute what Samsung perspective matter why have recently change stance become more aggressive bring patent infringement suit against Apple when release iPhone Alvin yes true Samsung have now launch more aggressive counter attack risk lose large amount order component -lrb- include mobile memory chip display -rrb- from Apple however Apple have so far refuse all settlement offer from android manufacturer have successfully convince court ban Samsung tablet Germany prevent release Australia push hard have Samsung device ban other major country so little room leave negotiation moment Samsung decide use occasion release Apple iPhone become more serious its counter attack Matt how do you see patent suit resolve Alvin stage hard predict exactly different law suit go across nine country trial likely extend more than one year however both company able ban each other product various country logical solution would Samsung Apple agree cross-license each other patent moment Apple have slight edge have successfully able ban Samsung product Germany remain see whether Samsung turn able have Apple device ban certain country well Matt which bring my final question what impact do you think issue could have Samsung credit profile what happen one-sided victory Apple Alvin believe one-sided victory Apple highly unlikely worst-case scenario eventuate clearly would weigh negatively Samsung credit profile Samsung mobile business division account around its revenue operating profit Apple win most law suit Samsung force recalibrate design its smartphone clear any patent infringement while maintain sufficient consumer appeal hence Samsung sale margin would negatively impact interim period however rather than outright victory one side note one-sided victory Samsung would quite negative Apple well compromise more likely where one side may gain slight advantage significantly importantly from regulatory point view Samsung hold flag many other smartphone maker would unlikely major court around world rule manner which ban Android operating system-based competition from compete against Apple device perhaps more important Samsung short-term could loss order memory chip display panel other component Apple source its various product while Apple contribution Samsung revenue operate profit disclose we watch closely from

advice give you wouldn bother pick individual stock do yourself favor invest mutual fund you re busy you re work full-time you presumably away tour long period invest individual stock hard time-consuming surprisingly expensive commission unnecessary over time overwhelming bulk you return aren go come from individual security re go come from pick right asset stock versus bond so sure you

conventional advice wrong you busy have neither time nor inclination go further should serve you well over next three four decade conventional wisdom Wall Street recommend standard portfolio stock bond rebalance once twice year sell what rise spend money buy what fall restore original allocation someone you age might cut bond allocation down even lower grounds you can afford take more risk which Wall Street mean volatility you feel comfortable simple portfolio one have number flaw miss out some investment class far too heavily weighted toward U.S. investment would have cost you plenty over past decade contrary what you hear overseas investment necessarily more risky here broader version standard portfolio U.S. stock e.g. USAA Extended Market Index Fund -lrb- USMIX US -rrb- european

precious metal offer portfolio insurance have typically do best when everything else have do badly commodity offer protection against inflation perhaps rise danger global shortage cap off strategy principle dollar cost averaging mean invest you money slowly over time Don commit all you fund once way you ll minimize risk buy top some security expensive today fall due course so even though you ll overpay those you buy now you ll probably get bargain those you buy later so you have say invest you could decide invest every quarter next two half year base portfolio above would mean invest each three stock fund apiece each bond fund apiece commodity gold fund -lrb- one technical note you pay trading commission commodity gold fund exchange-traded so you might want invest more fewer interval keep those commission down -rrb- you go down route you have stay disciplined ignore headline ignore you emotion ignore greed fear mood market just keep invest exactly same amount money same investment
